\section*{Memory Management}
\subsection*{Main Memory}
MM is the only storage the CPU can access directly. \textbf{Speed:} CPU Registers > Cache > Main Memory.
\begin{description}
    % Main Memory Partitions: resident OS in high PA, user Ps usually in low pa
    \item[Base and limit registers] smallest legal mem. address + size. Define \textbf{Logical Address Space (LAS)} of a P (set of all LA's). P can only access memory inside LAS (otherwise trap $\rightarrow$ fatal error). Only OS can access all registers/memory. \\
    \item[Logical Address / Virtual Address] generated by CPU. visible to user. editable \\
    \item[Physical Address] only seen by Memory Unit. does not change. \textbf{PAS} set of  all PAs correspoding to LAS \\
    \item[Address Binding] mapping instructions and data to memory addresses. 3 schemes/stages: (in red) \\
    %TODO: \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{05_mem.jpg}
    \item[Memory Management Unit MMU] HW device, maps LA to PA during execution. $\rightarrow$ mapping methods (relocation register, contiguous paging) \\
    \item[Dynamic Loading]: routine not loaded in memory until called. all routines kept on disk. no special os support needed \textbf{Static Linking}: Libraries and program code combined by loader. \textbf{Dynamic Linking} happens during execution. useful for shared libraries (standard C lib.) DLL: dynamically linked libraries. \\
    \item[Contiguous Memory Allocation] each P is contained in a single section of memory that is contiguous to the section containing the next P. \textbf{Memory Protection:} through usage of Relocation \& limit registers. degree of multiprog. limited by nr of partitions. \\
    \item[Dynamic Storage Allocation]: OS maintains list of allocated and free partitions (\textbf{Holes}). First-fit (fastest), Best-fit (eq. to ff in storage-utilization, produces smallest leftover-hole), worst-fit (produces largest leftover hole) \\
    \item[Internal Fragmentation]: physical memory organized into fixed-size blocks. happens if allocated memory larger than requested memory (internal to partition). \\
    \item[External Fragmentation]: Total Memory Space for requests exists, but is not contiguous. 50\% rule: 1/3 unusable. \textbf{Solutions} \textit{Compaction}: moving data, can be expensive, only possible with dynamic address relocation (during ex. time) \textit{Noncontinguous Allocation}: Strategy used in Paging \\
    \item[Paging] PA can be noncontiguous, memory for P allocated wherever possible (no ex. fragmentation, but some internal $\rightarrow$ smaller pages eq. less int. frag but move overhead in page table). Physical memory is divided into fixed-size blocks called \textbf{frames}. Logical memory divided into same-sized blocks called \textbf{pages}.\\
    \item[Adress-Translation]: page number and page offset in the per-P page table
    % \includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{05_paging.jpg} %TODO: modify image to include TLB
    \item[] OS keeps copy of each per-P page table + maintains frame table (for each physical frame)
    \item[Hardware Implementation]: per-P page table kept in main memory. \textbf{PTBR} page-table base register (pointers) \& \textbf{PTLR} page-table length register (size of page table)
    \item[Translation Lookaside Buffer TLB]: also called associative memory. hw cache for page table. (page nr, frame)
    % replacement policies: round-robin, LRU, random. key kernel code can be wired down for permanent fast access
    \item[Memory Protection] protection bit (read-only, read-write) or valid-invalid bit (attached to each entry in the page table. indicates if legal (in LAS) or not)
    \item[Shared Pages]: reentrant (unchanging) code shared among Ps. ex: Standard C libary
    \item[Structure of the Page Table] \\
    \item[Hierarchical Page Table]: ex: two-level page table, page the page table. (forwa[d mapping) \\
    \item[Swapping]: moving P temporarily out of memory to a \textit{backing store} and brought back for continued execution. (P roll out, roll in). system maintains ready queue. $\rightarrow$ transfer time too high, not used in modern OS  \\
    %TODO: hashed page tables, inverted page tables (if addresses expand beyond 32bits)
    \item[Swapping with Paging]: pages of a P instead of whole P swapped. (page in, page out)
